# home-cluster-flux

USA-RedDragon's home cluster manifests. Each directory is a namespace and most apps are deployed using the `app` Helm chart at <https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/helm-charts>.

This cluster runs on [Talos](https://www.talos.dev/) and my configuration files for it are public at <https://github.com/USA-RedDragon/talos-configs>.
